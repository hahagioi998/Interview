A Simple Solution is to first check root, if itâ€™s greater than all of its descendants. Then check for children of root. Time complexity of this solution is O(n2)

An Efficient Solution is to compare root only with its children (not all descendants), if root is greater than its children and same is true for for all nodes, then tree is max-heap (This conclusion is based on transitive property of > operator, i.e., if x > y and y > z, then x > z).

The last internal node is present at index (2n-2)/2 assuming that indexing begins with 0.

Input:  arr[] = {90, 15, 10, 7, 12, 2}
Output: True
The given array represents below tree
       90
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
 7    12  2
The tree follows max-heap property as every
node is greater than all of its descendants.

Input:  arr[] = {9, 15, 10, 7, 12, 11}
Output: False
The given array represents below tree
       9
     /    \
   15      10
  /  \     /
 7    12  11
The tree doesn't follows max-heap property 9 is
smaller than 15 and 10, and 10 is smaller than 11.
