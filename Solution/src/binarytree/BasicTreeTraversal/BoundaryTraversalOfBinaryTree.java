/*
We break the problem in 3 parts:
1. Print the left boundary in top-down manner.
2. Print all leaf nodes from left to right, which can again be sub-divided into two sub-parts:
…..2.1 Print all leaf nodes of left sub-tree from left to right.
…..2.2 Print all leaf nodes of right subtree from left to right.
3. Print the right boundary in bottom-up manner.

We need to take care of one thing that nodes are not printed again. e.g. The left most node is also the leaf node of the tree.
