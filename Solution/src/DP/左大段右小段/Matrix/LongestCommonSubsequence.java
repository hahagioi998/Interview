/*
a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
        LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.

        1) Optimal Substructure:
Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).

If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])

If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2])

Examples:
1) Consider the input strings “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB”. Last characters match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as:
L(“AGGTAB”, “GXTXAYB”) = 1 + L(“AGGTA”, “GXTXAY”)
longest-common-subsequence
2) Consider the input strings “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR. Last characters do not match for the strings. So length of LCS can be written as:
L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFHR”) = MAX ( L(“ABCDG”, “AEDFHR”), L(“ABCDGH”, “AEDFH”) )

So the LCS problem has optimal substructure property as the main problem can be solved using solutions to subproblems.
